AirView - AirPlay viewer for iOS devices
Copyright (c) 2010 Cl√©ment Vasseur <clement.vasseur@gmail.com>

Use this application to watch AirPlay video streams from another iOS device
(iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad running iOS 4.2) on the same local network, or from
iTunes.

Just launch AirView, then tap the AirPlay icon on the YouTube media player from
another iPhone for example, and the video should start playing on AirView. This
works with videos played in iTunes on a Mac or PC too.

Photos are not supported yet.
